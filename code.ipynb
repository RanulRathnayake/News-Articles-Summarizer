      "The question of whether a sitting US president can be forced to stand trial for state-level criminal charges has never been litigated.\n",
      "Wade said in the interview Wednesday that he expects prosecutors and defense attorneys will have to confront that unprecedented scenario if Trump wins the 2024 election.\n",
      "Nathan Wade was asked if he thinks Trump can still be on trial as president.\n",
      "Trial court Judge Scott McAfee had previously ruled that Willis could remain on the case if Wade stepped away, prompting his resignation.\n"
